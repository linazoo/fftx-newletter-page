              You will be able to sponsor a section of our newsletter, depending
              on which tier you choose we decide where/what newsletter we put it
              on. The real difference between them is where they'll be and what
              a 'premium' spot is. we can talk about that.

            <h3 className="h3">🍒 Premier 2K</h3>

              Do you want to tell a story about your product or brand and share
              it with women & LGBTQ+ creatives, entrepenuers, and small business
              owners? This would be a whole section of the newsletter to
              yourself to tell your story, we'll place it in a premium spot.
              Note: We can think about how we would collaborate with them,
              creating the content with them? collaboration? do we do the whole
              thing? put a fftx 'tone' on it

              Sponsor our 'volunteering newsletter' the whole thing. Our
              Volunteering program is very popular and we have tons of events we
              get the word out for. Note: We can think about what the actual
              tiers end up being but I'm trying to think about them
            </p>
            <h3 className="h3 ">🌈Premier Gold</h3>
            <p className="sub-header">1 spot per issue $600 - $1000 </p>
            <p className="text">
              Sponsor the calendar section of our newsletter, or the photo
              sections from one of our markets. Maybe we can somehow tie one of
              these to a programming related content? i.e. A spot in our Fall
              Market newsletters{" "}
            </p>
            <h3 className="h3 ">🥭Premier Silver </h3>

              One liner that says "sponsored by Titos" or something like that,
              nothing too crazy but just paying for the space. This might be a
              good one to start off with and its doable with little work for us
              depending on how this would be added on MailChimp ofc.
