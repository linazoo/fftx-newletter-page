              You will be able to sponsor a section of our newsletter, depending
              on which tier you choose we decide where/what newsletter we put it
              on. The real difference between them is where they'll be and what
              a 'premium' spot is. we can talk about that.

              it with women & LGBTQ+ creatives, entrepenuers, and small business
              owners? This would be a whole section of the newsletter to
              yourself to tell your story, we'll place it in a premium spot.
              Note: We can think about how we would collaborate with them,
              creating the content with them? collaboration? do we do the whole
              thing? put a fftx 'tone' on it

              Sponsor an event or announcement. One liner that says "sponsored
              by Titos" or something like that, nothing too crazy but just
              paying for the space. This might be a good one to start off with
              and its doable with little work for us depending on how this would
              be added on MailChimp ofc.
